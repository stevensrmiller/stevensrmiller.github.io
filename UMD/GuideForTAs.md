# Guidelines for Teaching Assistants

Thanks for being a Teaching Assistant for me this term. I've put together a few notes to let you know what my expectations are and to help give you something to refer to if you need it.

First up, here I am, as my University picture doesn't really resemble me anymore:

## Class Participation

If your schedule allows it, it's nice to have you in the classroom when I'm teaching. A lot of class time goes into project work or assignments. Having you there can be a big help to the students who might need some guidance when I'm already working with someone, or when maybe a different perspective is what a student needs to understand something they're having trouble with.

If you are unable to make every class, or your schedule doesn't allow it, that's okay. Make the ones you can, but it's not a requirement that you be there.

## Logistics

### Office Hours

Please try to schedule regular office hours when you are available to help students. My office hours are Mondays from 10:00 am to noon. It's best if you can have your office hours at some other time, and also at a time different from your fellow TA(s) for the same course.

Feel free to use Zoom for office hours. Students seem to like it because it saves them travel time. Also, most problems will involve looking at code. Zoom is great for that because you can share the student's desktop and take remote control. This works best with the actual Zoom application, so avoid using (and have the students avoid using) the web version of Zoom.

### Staff Meetings

We will have a weekly meeting via Zoom so we can quickly discuss any issues or problems. Usually, I find this works best on Fridays, but let me know what dates and times you prefer and we'll find a time that works for all of us.

Very often, we can let each other know of any minor issues, or that there are no issues at all, by email ahead of the weekly meeting. In those cases, I'll send an email letting you know we are skipping the meeting. In practice, that tends to happen at least half the time.

### Absences

If you will be absent from campus at any time this semester, please tell me _as early as you can_, so I can schedule around it. It's perfectly okay to travel for conferences, special events, and so on. Just tell me by emails as soon as you know that you are going to be gone, so we can avoid any problems that creates.

### Speaking of Email

Please talk to the department staff about getting a "umd.edu" email address if you don't already have one. This is necessary for privacy reasons when you communicate with students. If you currently only have a "terpmail.umd.edu" address, talk to the staff right away so you can have a "umd.edu" address assigned. Until you get one, you can talk to the students about issues relating to class work, but don't discuss their grades using your "terpmail.umd.edu" address.

## If There is Another TA

### Work Together

Most of my courses either have more than one TA, or else I have more than one section and each section has its own TA. Regardless, if there is another TA assisting me with the same course (either because you have been assigned with another, or you are the only TA in your section, but there is another TA in another section), please cooperate and coordinate the work with each other. All students in my courses get the same assignments, regardless of which section they are in. And, as with in-class help. sometimes what a student needs is just to work out a problem with a different person helping them.

### Shared Grading

This is an important point: If you and another TA split up the grading of an assignment, __do not divide the submissions from the students into groups__. A common, but badly flawed, approach is for one TA to grade everyone whose last name starts with the letters from A to M, and the other TA to grade everyone whose last name starts with the letters from N to Z.

__Don't do this!__

Here's why not: If you split the students, each TA will grade some of the same problems the other TA grades. This means that the same answer on two different submissions could be graded differently because the two of you don't use the same standards. Students notice this and are rightly upset when it happens.

__Instead, do this:__ If you want to split the work of grading an assignment, split the assignment itself into two parts, with one TA grading one part for all students, and the other TA grading the other part for all students. For example, if an assignment has six questions on it, one of you should grade questions 1, 2, and 3 for _all_ students, and the other one should grade questions 4, 5, and 6 for _all_ students. (Note that, if you think one question takes a lot more time to grade than the others, you don't have to split an assignment into equal numbers of questions. Divide the work as you feel is right for everyone to need the same amount of time to complete grading their part.)

## Grading

### Timing

Most of my assignments are issued on a Thursday and are due the following Thursday. This means there is always one weekend for the students to work on an assignment. Please do your best to have each assignment graded by the end of the weekend following the Thursday when it is due. I know some assignments take longer to grade than others. When that happens, let me know and, in those cases, try to get it done by the end of the _second_ weekend following the Thursday when it is due.

If you have any questions about how to grade something, please  email me about it, telling me the student's name, which assignment it is, and what your question is. I'll answer by email or we may have a short Zoom call about it.

Please do not be afraid to grade low! It is much easier to raise a low grade if a student gives a valid reason for us to do so, than it is to lower a grade after it has been given.

If you split the grading work with another TA, please pay close attention to the __Shared Grading__ section above.

### Accepting Late Work

My official policy is that __There Is No Late Work__. However, in 
practice, I do give extensions when people need them for a valid reason. So if someone turns in work after the deadline, please note that it was late (ELMS does this automatically for work submitted on ELMS, which is usually how we'll get it), but grade it normally. I'll handle any penalties.

### Publishing Grades

Please do __not__ publish any grades. When all grades for an assignment have been entered into ELMS, send me an email letting me know. I'll publish them. It's possible someone has a long extension and is still waiting to turn it in. Students are told not to discuss assignments until _after_ grades are published, precisely because someone with an extension might be tempted to cheat by talking about an assignment as though they have already turned it in.

### Speaking of Cheating

If you see two submissions with similar work and you think it is even possible two students have improperly worked together, or that one may have somehow copied the other, _let me know_. This is a simple matter of enforcing the Honor Code. As my Teaching Assistant, it is your duty to let me know if you think a violation might have happened. I will make the decision on how to pursue it, so don't worry that you are causing any problems. Your job is to show me what you have seen yourself. I'll take it from there.

---

Thanks again for being my Teaching Assistant. Most do a good job, and I expect you will do a good job too. I think most also enjoy the experience. Even if you do not intend to teach after you graduate, helping someone learn something new is an uplifting experience, which I hope you will have throughout this term.
