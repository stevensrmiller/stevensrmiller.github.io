	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<font face="Arial, sans-serif">I use more than one social media
	service. Some, like the magnificent Mastodon, impose short limits on
	posts (which, of course, you can get around with a picture, but
	screen-readers can't easily handle those). So, to avoid those limits
	and also to avoid repeating myself, I put this page together as a
	centralized location for some stuff I would otherwise probably end
	up saying over and over.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<font face="Arial, sans-serif">For decades in online life, I never
	blocked anyone. I had this misguided idea that, somehow, if you
	reasoned with someone long enough, they'd see sense. Or, conversely,
	maybe if you engaged them long enough, you might see sense in what
	they said. Either way, it seemed kind of cowardly to block someone
	in a context where they can only reach you with information, not
	physical abuse.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<font face="Arial, sans-serif">Well, that all changed about the time
	I turned 60 years old. Looking back, I saw that hardly anyone I was
	tempted to block ever saw sense, no matter how long I reasoned with
	them. And, admittedly, it was pretty rare that any such person
	persuaded me to change my own view on whatever it was we disagreed
	about. So, realizing that life was getting short, I started blocking
	people. Wow, what a great moment that was! Suddenly, I stopped
	wasting a lot of time on people who were, well, getting me to waste
	a lot of time. Let me tell you, when you turn 60, you start thinking
	about time in whole new ways.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">

	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<font face="Arial, sans-serif">So, here they are, the reasons I
	block people:</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<font face="Arial, sans-serif">1. You assert a fact without offering
	supporting evidence and, when I ask you for supporting evidence, you
	either tell me to &quot;do your own research,&quot; or you say
	something about having common sense. See, I'm a science teacher and
	I'm also a lawyer. In both of those disciplines, we expect anyone
	who asserts something to either back it up themselves or admit they
	can't prove the assertion. The burden is on the person who asserts
	something to prove that something. And, no, your common sense is not
	proof. I have common sense too and, if I ask you for supporting
	evidence, it's because common sense alone wasn't enough. So, if you
	react to a polite request for supporting evidence this way, you get
	blocked.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<font face="Arial, sans-serif">2. You are a bigot, a MAGAt, a
	flat-Earther, a conspiracy theorist, a gun nut, an anti-vaxer, a
	Bernie bro, or think climate change is a hoax, you get blocked. Note
	that &quot;bigot&quot; includes, but is not limited to, being
	anti-LGBT+, anti-POC, anti-women, or if you are pretty much any
	other kind of person who exhibits invidious discrimination, you get
	blocked.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<font face="Arial, sans-serif">3. You tell me you think the laws of
	nature are subjective, or that your ability to accept the
	possibilities of things like faster-than-light travel, mind-reading,
	astral projection, communication with the dead, or psychokinesis is
	because you have not been educated in science and, unlike me, are
	therefore at greater liberty to entertain thoughts of the
	impossible, you get blocked. (You are free to think these things,
	just don't tell me my science classes cost me any freedom of thought
	that you still have and I don't.)</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<font face="Arial, sans-serif">4. You are insulting, annoying,
	threatening, demeaning, condescending, or otherwise deliberately
	being a jerk and don't shape up after having it pointed out to you,
	you get blocked. I usually say something the first time. Anyone can
	have a bad moment at the keyboard. But do it after a warning and I
	block you.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<font face="Arial, sans-serif">5. You waste my time, you get
	blocked. (I'm old goddammit. See above.)</font></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<br/>

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-right: 2.06in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent">
	<font face="Arial, sans-serif">Remarkably, even though I block
	people now, the overwhelming majority of folks I meet online do not
	get blocked, including most of those I passionately disagree with. I
	love conversing with that majority. Blocking the tiny percentage
	that are dicks, pricks, whacks, or jerks gives me more time to do
	so. Overall, I'm finding it's a trade that pays me. Hope that helps.</font></p>
