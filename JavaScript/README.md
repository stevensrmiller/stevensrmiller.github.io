# JavaScript HTML Examples
 
Simple stand-alone web pages and some associated short JavaScript programs to demonstrate some purely client-side capabilities.

## Contents

Here you will find small programs written entirely in HTML and JavaScript. In the style of 20th century educational code, the programs are commented with the intent that, by reading the code, you will be able to learn what you need to use the same techniques in your own code. The directory names will typically tell you what each sample demonstrates.

## We need more JavaScript tutorials?

I find that some things are easy to learn from a tutorial or reference guide, while others can be best learned by examining a small, complete example. My personal investigations into JavaScript via the many excellent web pages devoted to explaining it were frustrating. In particular, the difference between the JavaScript language itself and the available objects provided by the Document Object Model, wasn't clear to me at first. These examples won't necessarily help anyone with that issue any better than existing materials do, but at least these examples work. Starting with a complete working set of code that you can modify is how many people learn best. Also, repos like this one become my personal "HowTo" guide, that I can return to when I need a reminder. I make them public so others can get whatever benefit they can from them.

## Ennvironment

For examples using modules (which is, or will be, most of them), you need to load your pages from a server, not as files. If you use VS Code, just add the "Live Server" extenstion
by Ritwick Dey. Right-click on the HTML file you want to load in VS Code's Explorer, and pick "Open with Live Server."

**NOTE:** If you are seeing this page alone with **Stevens R. Miller** at the top,
you are at the actual web site, not the Github repo.
