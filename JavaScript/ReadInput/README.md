# ReadInput

This one makes it possible to create complete applications that all run
in the browser. It shows a direct way to read the text in an input box
and copy it to an output section. Of course, you could process it first.

All of the JavaScript for this one is in the HTML file, to keep it easy
to find, as this one doesn't exemplify any reuseable features or code.
