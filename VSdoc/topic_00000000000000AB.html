        A system for defining a reusable abstraction that can represent a large
variety of puzzle/escape game objects. The abstractions, called &quot;Gadgets,&quot;
use events to communicate with observers that draw pictures and render
sounds when the human player interacts with them. A system of condition
lists, paired with action lists, decouples the Gadgets at the code level,
while allowing them to be connected logically in a game context.
<p>
The condition list was created by Richard Stamp. The rotor-based Gadget
system and C# event notifiers were created by Stevens Miller

	  </td>

A concrete Gadget that supports any number of &quot;rotors,&quot; which
can have one of a specified number of states. For example, an
on/off button could be based on a ComboGadget with one rotor
that has two states. A four-digit bicycle lock could be based
on a ComboGadget with four rotors that have ten states.

A state is defined by an integer, but can be assigned any sort
of appearance by a GadgetObserver. So, the on/off button's one
rotor has either state = 0 or state = 1. But on the screen, the
state = 0 could be presented as the button in the up position,
and state = 1 could be presented as the button in the down
position. Likewise, a state could be the position of a knob, or
it could be the angle of a lever, or it could be one of several
different shapes or pictures.

        For clinet code, this is a read-only property. Internally, when it is set,
        it will always notify all GadgetObservers that have subscribed to the OnUpdate
        event (and any other objects that have subscribed to it, as well). If the
        completed state changes when it is set (that is, when a not completed Gadget
        becomes completed, or a completed Gadget becomes not completed) it will notify
        all ConditionLists that have subscribed to the OnConditionChanged event (and
        any other objects that have subscribed to it, as well).

Abstract parent class for classes that present a human-friendly
visual (or, possibly, audible) form of a Gadget. Whenever a
Gadget's Interact method is called, whether it changes state or
not, a GadgetObserver assigned to that Gadget will have its
UpdateListener method called.
<p>
Note that the GadgetObserver presumes there is a Gadget on its
GameObject, so it finds it and assigns the GadgetListener method
to its OnUpdate event. Subclasses of this class will need to cast
the Gadget to the particular subclass of Gadget they observe. They
will also need to provide a concrete implementation of the
UpdateListener method.

Simple class to put on a child GameObject of a GameObject that has
a Knobs GadgetObserver on it. Reports to the Knobs objects when a
Knob has been clicked, passing its Knob number, so the Knobs object
can use it in a call to its Gadget's Interact method, and so the
Knobs object can update this Knob's transform (to make it appear to
turn).

An observer for a ComboGadget that simulates a set of rotation knobs.

GameObjects as there are rotors in the ComboGadget, and add a Knob
component to each child GameObject. Set each Knob's number to

	  </td>
	  <td>

This is an example of how to add a state to an existing Gadget.
This class subclasses the ComboGadget and adds a &quot;locked&quot; state.
By using a ConditionList, a set of conditions, in the form of
Gadgets that must be completed, must be met to &quot;unlock&quot; this
Gadget. Until it is unlocked, the Gadget does not respond to
Interact calls by changing any of its rotors. When the list of
conditions is met, the ConditionList can call this object's
SetUnLocked method to unlock at, at which point it begins
passing calls to its Interact method up to the parent class's
Interact method.
<p>
Note that this class could respond to interactions any way it
wished to, instead of just ignoring the which and what parameters.
Any subclass of Gadget can use this approach to have as many
state variables as it wants, all of which can be used to decide
how the Gadget responds to a call to its Interact method.
</p>
<p>
This implementation is in consideration of the fairly common
scenario where a game item, like combination lock, cannot be
interacted with until some prior conditions are met, such as
turning on a power supply.
